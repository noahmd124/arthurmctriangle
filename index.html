<p>  Here is a very helpful video explaining HTML </p>

 <h3> Or follow this step by step guide: </h3>
 
 <p> 1) To code your website, you could use any text edior - Visual Code and Notepad++ work really well though. This website was coded with Notepad++
		
		<br> </br>
		
 2) For Notepad++, download it online. Then, create a new one and save it, calling it index.html 
 To see your website, right click it and press open with Google (or the browser you are using). I have my pages side by side, so that I can code, save and refresh the page and my changes are there! 
  
		<br> </br>
 3) Start your file with the tags < html > and < body > (I have to do it with spaces or else it disappears - don't do it with the spaces in ) You should also put these tags at the bottom of your code, but like </ body > and then </ html > to end it.
